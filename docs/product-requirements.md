# Angular Design System

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Status:** MVP Draft  

## 1. Introduction

This simplified PRD focuses on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of our Angular Design System to enable rapid development and iteration.

## 2. Technical Foundation

- Angular v20+ with standalone components
- SCSS for styling with CSS variables
- Signal-based state management
- Storybook integration
- OnPush change detection

## 3. MVP Components
