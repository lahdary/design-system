# Accessibility Guide

This guide outlines the accessibility features and best practices for our design system components.

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

All components in our design system are built to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, which include:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Component-Specific Accessibility Features

### Button Component

- Uses native `<button>` element for proper keyboard accessibility
- Includes appropriate ARIA attributes when needed
- Disables buttons properly with both `disabled` attribute and `aria-disabled`
- Shows focus state clearly for keyboard users
- Loading state communicated via both visual indicator and ARIA

### Text Input Component

- Associates labels with inputs using `for` and `id` attributes
- Includes `aria-required` attribute for required fields
- Uses `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` for error states
- Provides helper text and error messages that are properly associated with inputs
- Supports keyboard interaction standards

### Card Component

- Uses proper heading hierarchy within cards
- Interactive cards include appropriate keyboard navigation and focus states
- Content structure maintains a logical reading order

### Alert Component

- Uses `role="alert"` to ensure screen readers announce content
- Dismissible alerts have accessible close buttons with clear labels
- Icons are properly implemented for assistive technology
- Color is not the only means of conveying information

### Badge Component

- Color combinations meet contrast requirements
- Text is readable at various sizes
- Information conveyed by badges is available through other means

## Keyboard Navigation

Our components support the following keyboard navigation standards:

- **Tab**: Move focus to the next focusable element
- **Shift+Tab**: Move focus to the previous focusable element
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons, links, and other controls
- **Escape**: Close modals, dialogs, and dismissible elements

## Screen Reader Support

Components are tested with popular screen readers:

- NVDA and JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (macOS and iOS)
- TalkBack (Android)

## Color and Contrast

Our design system maintains a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

The color palette includes:

- Base colors that meet contrast requirements
- Accessible color combinations for all component states
- Focus indicators that are visible for keyboard users

## Typography

Text is designed to be readable:

- Font sizes are specified in relative units (em, rem) to support browser text resizing
- Line heights ensure proper spacing for readability
- Text spacing can be adjusted without breaking components

## Responsive Design

Components are designed to be accessible across devices:

- Support 200% zoom without loss of content or functionality
- Adapt to different screen sizes and orientations
- Maintain touch targets of at least 44Ã—44 pixels on mobile

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure components are accessible:

- [ ] Validate with automated tools (axe, Lighthouse)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces content correctly
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios
- [ ] Test with page zoomed to 200%
- [ ] Verify touch targets on mobile devices
- [ ] Test with reduced motion settings
- [ ] Validate semantic HTML structure

## Recommendations for Developers

1. **Use components as intended**: Don't override accessibility features
2. **Maintain heading hierarchy**: Use headings (h1-h6) correctly
3. **Include alt text**: Always provide alt text for images
4. **Test keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed via keyboard
5. **Use aria attributes judiciously**: Only add ARIA when necessary and follow best practices
