# Button Directive

The Button Directive is a flexible Angular directive that applies styling and behavior to native button elements.

## Basic Usage

The primary button is used for the most important action on a page or in a form.

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Primary} sourceState="shown">
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Primary} />
</Canvas>

## Button Variants

The Button Directive supports multiple variants to express different levels of emphasis.

### Secondary Button

Used for secondary actions that complement the primary action.

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Secondary}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Secondary} />
</Canvas>

### Tertiary Button

Used for less important actions or in contexts where visual prominence needs to be minimal.

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Tertiary}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Tertiary} />
</Canvas>

## Button Sizes

The Button Directive provides three size options to fit different UI contexts.

### Small Button

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Small}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Small} />
</Canvas>

### Medium Button (Default)

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Medium}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Medium} />
</Canvas>

### Large Button

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Large}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Large} />
</Canvas>

## States

### Disabled Button

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Disabled}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Disabled} />
</Canvas>

### Loading Button

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Loading}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Loading} />
</Canvas>

## Layout

### Full Width Button

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_FullWidth}>
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_FullWidth} />
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

- Use **Primary buttons** for the main call-to-action
- Use **Secondary buttons** for alternative actions
- Use **Tertiary buttons** for less important actions
- Limit the number of primary buttons on a page to avoid competing actions
- Ensure button text clearly describes the action
- Keep button labels concise and action-oriented
- Maintain consistent button usage patterns across your application
- Use the appropriate size for the context (typically medium for most scenarios)

## Accessibility

- All buttons support keyboard navigation
- Includes `aria-label` support for better screen reader access
- Maintains adequate color contrast for all states
- Loading state communicates status to screen readers
- Focus states are clearly visible for keyboard users

## Implementation Example

```html
<button
  ds-ui-button
  variant="primary"
  size="md"
  [disabled]="isDisabled"
  [loading]="isLoading"
  [fullWidth]="shouldBeFullWidth"
  ariaLabel="Submit form"
  (clicked)="handleSubmit()"
>
  Submit
</button>
```
