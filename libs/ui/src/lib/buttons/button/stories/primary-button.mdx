# Primary Button

The primary button is the main call-to-action element in your user interface. It should be used for the most important action on a page or form.

<Canvas of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Primary} sourceState="shown">
  <Story of={ButtonDirectiveStories.Directive_Primary} />
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

The primary button should:

- Be used sparingly (ideally one primary button per view)
- Clearly communicate the main action
- Stand out visually from other UI elements
- Have concise, action-oriented text (e.g., "Submit", "Save", "Continue")

## Implementation

```html
<button ds-ui-button variant="primary" (clicked)="handleAction()">
  Primary Action
</button>
```

## Accessibility

- Meets WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast requirements
- Supports keyboard navigation and focus states
- Works with screen readers through appropriate ARIA attributes
